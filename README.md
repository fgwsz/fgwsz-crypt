# fgwsz-package

`fgwsz-package` is a tool for packing and unpacking files.  
The contents of packages created with this tool are obfuscated using random 
encoding.

```txt
The package standard for archiving one or more (files/directories) with fgwsz-package:
    The binary file structure of the package is as follows:
        [file item 1]...[file item N]
    The binary information structure for each file item [file item] consists of [A|B|C|D]:
        Part A: [relative path bytes (8 bytes)]
        Part B: [relative path]
        Part C: [content bytes (8 bytes)]
        Part D: [content (binary)]
```

Package files generated by `fgwsz-package` can have any file extension.

To avoid the dilemma of needing to open a package with a mysterious file 
extension but not knowing which software to use, we hereby establish the 
convention that package files generated by `fgwsz-package` will uniformly use 
the `.fgwsz` file extension.

The command-line usage for `fgwsz-package` is as follows:

```txt
Usages:
    Pack  : -c <output package path> <input path 1> ... <input path N>
    Unpack: -x <input package path> <output directory path>
Examples:
    Pack a file and directory: -c 0.fgwsz README.md source
    Unpack                   : -x 0.fgwsz output
```

A feature (not a bug):

The presence or absence of `/` at the end of a directory path in pack mode 
affects the packing logic:

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;If the input directory path does NOT have `/` at the end,
the entire directory, including the directory itself, is matched.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;If the input directory path has `/` at the end,
all subdirectories/files under the entire directory are matched, excluding the 
directory itself.

Current working directory structure:

    ./
    |
    +----source/
    |    |
    |    |----main.cpp
    |    |----hello_world.h
    |    +----hello_world.cpp
    |
    +----README.md

Case 1: Using a directory path (without '/' at the end) for packing and unpacking

    fgwsz-package -c 0.fgwsz README.md source
    fgwsz-package -x 0.fgwsz out

    The output path 'out' directory structure:

        out/
        |
        +----source/
        |    |
        |    |----main.cpp
        |    |----hello_world.h
        |    +----hello_world.cpp
        |
        +----README.md

Case 2: Using a directory path (with '/' at the end) for packing and unpacking

    fgwsz-package -c 0.fgwsz README.md source/
    fgwsz-package -x 0.fgwsz out

    The output path 'out' directory structure:

        out/
        |
        |----main.cpp
        |----hello_world.h
        |----hello_world.cpp
        +----README.md
```
Coding Issues:

```txt
The Linux operating system uses UTF-8 encoding by default, so no settings are required.

For the Windows operating system, please first set the global encoding to UTF-8. The setting method is as follows:
    Region Settings → Check the option "Beta: Use Unicode UTF-8 for worldwide language support"
    This will prevent encoding errors when using this software on the Windows system.
```
